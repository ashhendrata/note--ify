Secrecy is important. Especially for kidnapping victims and individuals in abusive relationships... 

Enter Note-ify. 

Its name a play on double meaning, at a glance, it's a simple virtual piano app that produces NOTES. However, it harbors a powerful secret: play the correct melody, and you unlock a hidden, secure communication channel that will let you NOTIFY others. 
This isn't just any messaging platform; Note-ify disguises all interactions within layers of decoy conversations, ensuring that even if someone accesses your device, your real communications remain hidden.

## Features
* A piano keyboard that allows you to have fun with melodies... It has a vertical orientation so that you won't cause suspicion once you enter the "password", the correct melody
* Texting channels with people you add via phone number
* Real conversations with high stakes hidden with decoy conversations made with Gemini API
* Actual conversations temporarily revealed with the click of a button

## How we built it
* We built the mobile application with Kotlin, deciding that having easy, constant access to our app was important for our users
* With the use of Gemini API, we created decoy conversations that were realistic, but hid the true interactions happening
* We divided the work up based on the "stages" of the app, learning that teamwork makes the dreamwork!

## Challenges we ran into
* Most of us learned mobile development in the span of a few hours. Learning a new framework was a challenge given the new world that is Kotlin.
* Creating the decoy conversations was the hardest part considering the multiple layers of code we had to think about.
* Working with Gemini API was a challenge but a fun one! Linking it with our code and choosing the prompts were tough, understanding that casual responses were crucial to our users' security.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We made a functional app as a team!
* Security is the name of the game and we feel like our app could really help people.
* We learned a lot through this project, especially in regard to how far we can push ourselves!

## What we learned
* Mobile development and Kotlin was a learning curve for most of us.
* Harnessing the power of Gemini: We learned how cool it was in terms of adapting it for our own purposes.
* We learned that UCLA libraries are 10/10!!!

## What's next for Note-ify
* Launching it on official app stores!
* Facing the challenge of marketing an app that has an illusion of being a simple virtual piano.
* Bettering the decoy conversations using Gemini API to decrease the risks of arousing suspicion
